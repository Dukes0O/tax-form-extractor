- The mapping is loaded from `GIFI_map.xlsx` which contains 698 mappings
- Sample mappings:
  ```
  [('3460', 'GFGIB.Ttwgib34'), 
   ('3470', 'GFGIB.Ttwgib35'),

## Conclusion

The Tax Form Extractor project has made significant progress with the implementation of the GIFI mapping functionality, page selection for PDF documents, and integration with OpenAI's GPT-4o model. The application now provides a user-friendly interface for uploading tax forms, selecting specific pages for processing, and extracting GIFI codes and values.

The next phase will focus on comprehensive testing of the OpenAI integration, page selection functionality, and end-to-end workflow to ensure the application works reliably with various tax form types and formats.
